Briefly explain the work that you did on this project:
What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For Project Two I developed code that addressed creating each episode, epoch loops, appropriate times to switch between a random move or the quality algorithm, when references of the actions should be taken in the neural network to use in later episodes and the states of wins and losses. I was given both the Keras and dependent libraries for Project two along with the model structure used in the neural network. Additionally, the project was loaded with controllers for the default variables that the model parameters along the number of episodes used to initiate the treasure hunter program completed by the intelligent agent.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

As a computer scientist, work is completed to create solutions that are intuitive and efficient. They work to benefit mankind with the use of computers. This course has allowed me to expand my knowledge of AI and how it fits into the future of the growing field of computer science. With the knowledge I have gained, I can deliver automation and simplicity to computer programs through implemention of AI in future projects I’m a part of. The solutions are very important as they affect creators of the software and people who interact with it. Considering this, through this course, I have learned how regulations such as the EU's GDPR protect people and their data using AI.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, approaches in solving a problem are necessary by asking questions like, how can something be improved, how would solutions work to benefit others, are there any solutions that would work better, and are the solutions ethical. By asking those questions, we can ensure that what we’re doing is the right thing, beneficial, and not harmful ethically.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

With the regulations put in place like the EU's GDPR, protecting people’s data and the way it’s used is an ethical responsibility of all computer science professionals. Being a computer scientist comes with the responsibility to protect a user’s best interests. This is just as important as writing code that is useful for each application. If we can’t write code that protects people, or users, who are we developing applications for. Ethics are extremely important when working with data, especially users’ data. I prime example with using data is that it should only be used as needed, anonymized when available, and kept secure to prevent unauthorized access to prevent data from ending up in the wrong hands.
